for this i had to google lots of stuff
- where does ff stores the history
- what format is it stored in
- how to open the sqlite file
- how to write the sql command to get the data from the sql file
 and also the timestamp was in microseconds so to give the answer i had to update my sql query to divide by 1 million and then converted it to epoch
